    "Let us conduct a stochastic experiment: we throw $N$ pebbles randomly into a square with radius $1$ (we assume that each possible position in the square is equally probable) and we further note how many of the $N$ pebbles are actually landing within distance $1$ of the lower left corner of the square. If $N_\\mathrm{hit}$ is that number, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{4 N_\\mathrm{hit}}{N} \\approx \\pi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "if $N$ is sufficiently large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? The number $N_\\mathrm{hit}$ describes how many of the $N$ pebbles have a distances of one from the lower left corner, i.e., the have fallen inside a (quarter-) circle of radius $r=1$ which is centered at the lower left corner. The area of full circle of radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2$; thus, the area of a quarter circle with $r=1$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. The area of the square, in which all $N$ pebbles must lie, is $r^2=1$. Since we assume a uniform distribution of pebble positions in the square, the ratio $\\frac{N_\\mathrm{hit}}{N}$ must be close to the ratio of areas between the quarter circle and the full square: $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement the above approximation for $\\pi$ as a Python function. To sample random positions in the unit square, you can use the `random` package, in particular, the function `uniform(a, b)` which returns a uniformly distributed random number $[a,b)$. Before you can use `uniform(a, b)`, you need to import this function as shown below:"
